# SolarHeaterSimulation
Physics simulation of energy conversion of thermal collector:

Problem : 
Write a simple software simulation of the following system.
Minimum Requirements:
1. The system should simulate the heat transfer from a solar panel to a storage tank
2. Use whichever coding language you wish
3. We will evaluate thermodynamic correctness, code approach, and results.
